## MORE INFOS
If you'd like to recreate this program, here's some might-be-useful informations you might like to know before doing so and why it's been ceased from operating.
- Roblox destroying cookies when the user's IP has been changed to a different region. Cool idea if you'd like to hear: use Discord websocket and basically make a Remote Code Execution (RCE) tool.
- Web browsing applications encrypting SQLite files. We have not much understanding how they work. So if you'd like, you can figure out yourself.
- Developer lacking motivation.

# RoCL-2
Please don't hack people. It's illegal!
